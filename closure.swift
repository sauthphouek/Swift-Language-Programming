// Teach me about closure 
// A closure is a self-contained block of code that can be passed around and used in your code.
// Closures are similar to functions, but they are defined in a more compact and flexible way.
// Closures are used to capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.

// Syntax
// { (parameters) -> returnType in
//     // code to be executed
// }


// Example
let greetUser = {
    print("Hello, User!")
}
